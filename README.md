### The Circle
At the heart of this geometric composition lies a circle, centred at the origin of a coordinate plane, with a radius of $100$ units. The equation governing this circle, though implicit in the SVG, can be derived as follows:

$$
(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 100^2
$$

This equation denotes that any point $(x, y)$ on the periphery satisfies this relationship, reinforcing the circular form. The presence of a `stroke-width` of `10` around the circle's outline slightly augments the visible radius, providing an additional $5$ units of apparent breadth around the circumference due to the outward extension of the stroke.

### The Horizontal and Vertical Elements – The Pi Configuration
The three linear elements within the circle are arranged to represent the Greek letter pi ($\Pi$), forming a symbolic and mathematical motif. The choice of this letter, renowned as a mathematical constant, may here signify not only a tribute to its historic importance but also the enduring relationship between circles and pi itself.

#### Horizontal Line – The Pi’s Capstone
The horizontal line, situated at $(y = -79)$, spans from $(x = -61.8)$ to $(x = 61.8)$. This line, evidently placed below the circle’s centre at a vertical position of $-79$, allows for a harmonious encapsulation within the circle’s bounds. This configuration appears to adhere to the golden ratio $(\phi)$, approximately $1.618$, a proportion historically celebrated for its aesthetic and structural elegance.

The selection of $\pm 61.8$ for the $x$-coordinates subtly aligns with this ratio:

$$
\frac{100}{\phi} \approx 61.8
$$

In this manner, the horizontal span evokes the golden proportion relative to the circle’s radius, infusing the design with a harmonious mathematical balance. The line itself has a `stroke-width` of $10$, identical to the circle's, which serves to visually unify the components while maintaining the stroke’s symbolic integrity.

#### Vertical Lines – The Uprights of Pi
The vertical lines, positioned at $x = -61.8$ and $x = 61.8$, rise from $y = -79$ to $y = 79$, preserving symmetry about the $y$-axis. This structure, with both lines equidistant from the origin, ensures a centripetal balance within the overall design. Their lengths extend across $158$ units vertically, thus remaining fully inscribed within the circle.

Mathematically, the lines are carefully crafted to be tangent to an imaginary rectangle with width $123.6$ (again reflecting the golden ratio when considering the total width, $2 \times 61.8$) and height $158$. This rectangular envelope fortifies the golden ratio aesthetic, as the horizontal proportion of the pi character’s "cap" to the circle’s diameter hearkens to a classical architectural proportion.

### Scholarly Interpretation and Geometric Discourse
The architectural order of this design imbues it with a classical harmony, where the principles of symmetry, proportionality, and centration govern its composition. The employment of the golden ratio further alludes to a long-standing Hellenic ideal of beauty, signifying an attempt to embody cosmic and aesthetic symmetry.

This SVG is a quintessential expression of the synthesis between mathematics and art, embodying π not merely as a letter but as a symbol of proportionality and infinity within the circle—a shape often construed as a metaphor for eternity and completeness in Hellenic philosophy. The white strokes, juxtaposed with the black canvas typically associated with such depictions, evoke a pristine clarity, emphasising the shape's form and its proportions without extraneous ornamentation.

In summation, the design achieves a robust adherence to both mathematical precision and artistic intentionality, emblematic of an era where geometry served as both the language of science and the muse of philosophy. It is thus an artefact as much of rationalist endeavour as of aesthetic veneration, a tribute to the enduring interconnection between mathematics and the visual arts, with roots deeply embedded in classical Greek thought.
